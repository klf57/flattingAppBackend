# flattingAppBackend

Backend of a flatting App with the goal to maintain organisation and peace among the people sharing the house together.
<br/> It uses express to connect to Mysql database. This is a small project to practice what I learnt 

<p/> To run, type in node app.js in the terminal while in the directory. If opening directory for the first time run npm install prior to that command.
<br/>
<br /> Currently scripts for the Sql Tables is not shared in the repo.
